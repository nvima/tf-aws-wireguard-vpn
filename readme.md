# Terraform AWS VPN with WireGuard

This is a Terraform project that creates an EC2 instance running a WireGuard VPN server on AWS. The `start.sh` script can be used to start the VPN, while `stop.sh` can be used to stop the server.

## Usage

To start the VPN, run the following command:

`./start.sh`


This will create the EC2 instance using Terraform, configure the WireGuard VPN server, and generate a client configuration file. The client configuration file will be saved locally at `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`.

To stop the VPN, run the following command:

`./stop.sh`


This will destroy the EC2 instance created by Terraform.

Note that running `start.sh` will not only create the EC2 instance, but also configure and start the WireGuard client on your local machine using the configuration file generated by the script. If you do not want this behavior or would like to change the location where the configuration file is stored, you can modify the `start.sh` and `stop.sh` scripts to fit your needs.

## Requirements

- Terraform
- AWS account and credentials
- WireGuard client
